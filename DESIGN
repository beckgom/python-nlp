* Basic idea
** Similar to java nlp framework, but in python
** Prototype design in python, implement any performace-dependent components in C
* Goals
** Easy to use
** Pythonic
** Fast 
* Timeline
** Prototype counter / countermap
** Naive Bayes
*** Test that basic counter stuff works
** FunctionMinimizer (as iterable?) / DifferentiableFunction
** Encoding / Decoding / IndexLinearizer (fast vector indexing operations)
** Maximum Entropy Model
** Fast math operations
*** Approximate operations
*** Optimized vector operations
*** Thread worker pools
** Chain models (HMM / MEMM)
*** Testing mostly
** Computationally intensive chain-models (CRF)
*** Test how well the framework scales (can it handle encodings / low-level access etc.)
