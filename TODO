Near-horizon goals (loosely pulled from DESIGN, but more pragmatic, not in any particular order)
- Refactor nlp C module (pull counter into a separate file)
- Refactor counter C module to re-use code better (define arithmetic ops as a set of macro calls to reduce code duplication)
+ Counter in-place scalar ops
+ HMM
+ Log-score HMM (current implementation underflows too much)
- Higher-order hmm
- HMM optimizations (frozen counter to deal with arg max time? need some better way of profiling the counter type)
- Generalize to generic chain model (pull out viterbi decoding)
- Approximate decoding (beam search, probably do this after the generic chain model stuff)
- MEMM implementation
- Emission smoothing - maxent emission fallbacks
- Transition smoothing -  attempt at learning class hierarchy to smooth transitions)
+ Penn treebank reader
- Analysis tool for classifiers / features (for NB & MaxEnt)
- Verifiably open datasets / standard data sets
