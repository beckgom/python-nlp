* Near-horizon goals (loosely pulled from DESIGN, but more pragmatic, not in any particular order)
** C module
*** TODO Refactor nlp C module (pull counter into a separate file)
*** DONE Refactor counter C module to re-use code better (define arithmetic ops as a set of macro calls to reduce code duplication)
*** DONE Counter in-place scalar ops
*** DONE Better error messages (not just internal error)
** DONE HMM
** DONE Log-score HMM (current implementation underflows too much)
** Viterbi improvements
*** TODO Higher-order hmm
*** TODO Generalize to generic chain model (pull out viterbi decoding)
*** TODO Rewrite core viterbi in C
** TODO HMM optimizations (frozen counter to deal with arg max time? need some better way of profiling the counter type)
** TODO Approximate decoding (beam search, probably do this after the generic chain model stuff)
** TODO MEMM implementation
** Emission smoothing
*** DONE Uniform fallbacks
*** DONE Naive bayes fallback
*** TODO Maxent emission fallbacks (way too slow for now)
*** TODO Generalized fallback model (fits in with pickling better?)
** TODO Checkpointing / pickling support (for parsing / training etc)
** TODO Transition smoothing -  attempt at learning class hierarchy to smooth transitions)
** DONE Penn treebank reader
** TODO Analysis tool for classifiers / features (for NB & MaxEnt)
** TODO Verifiably open datasets / standard data sets
