Near-horizon goals (loosely pulled from DESIGN, but more pragmatic, not in any particular order)
- Refactor nlp C module (pull counter into a separate file)
- Counter in-place scalar ops
+ HMM
- Log-score HMM (current implementation underflows too much)
- Higher-order hmm
+ Penn treebank reader
- Analysis tool for classifiers / features (for NB & MaxEnt)
- Verifiably open datasets / standard data sets
